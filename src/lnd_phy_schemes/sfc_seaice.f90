! The main program unit of the sea-ice parameterization scheme for NWP.
!
! It contains a number of procedures.
! SUBROUTINE seaice_init_nwp
! initializes the sea-ice scheme and performs some consistency checks.
! SUBROUTINE seaice_timestep_nwp
! advances prognostic variables of the sea-ice scheme one time step.
! SUBROUTINE seaice_coldinit_nwp
! performs a cold start of the sea-ice scheme.
! SUBROUTINE seaice_coldinit_albsi_nwp
! performs a cold start initialization of prognostic sea-ice albedo.
!
! The present sea-ice parameterization scheme is a bulk thermodynamic (no rheology) scheme
! intended for use in NWP and similar applications.
! The scheme is based on a self-similar parametric representation (assumed shape) of the
! evolving temperature profile within the ice and on the integral heat budget of the ice slab.
! The scheme carries ordinary differential equations (in time)
! for the ice surface temperature and the ice thickness.
! An explicit Euler scheme is used for time advance.
! In the current configuration of the scheme, snow over sea ice is not treated explicitly.
! The effect of snow above the ice is accounted for implicitly (parametrically).
! To this end, a rate equation for the sea-ice surface albedo
! with respect to (diffuse) solar radiation is used.
! The rate equation contains
! the relaxation terms that drive sea-ice albedo towards its equilibrium value,
! and "albedo source term" due to precipitation that accounts for the increase
! of albedo after snowfalls.
! The equilibrium albedo is a function of the sea-ice surface temperature.
! Optionally, the sea-ice albedo may be treated diagnostically using
! a temperature-dependent equilibrium albedo.
! For the "sea water" type ICON grid boxes, the snow thickness is set to zero and
! the snow surface temperature is set equal to the ice surface temperature
! (both temperatures are set equal to the fresh-water freezing point if the ice is absent).
!
! Prognostic equations for the ice thickness and the ice surface temperature are solved
! for the ICON grid boxes with the ice fraction
! (area fraction of a given model grid box of the type "sea water" that is covered by ice)
! that exceeds a threshold value of 0.0015. Otherwise, the grid box is treated as ice-free.
! The ice fraction is determined on the basis of observational data
! by the data assimilation scheme and is kept constant over the entire model forecast period.
! However, if the ice melts away during the forecast, the ice fraction is reset to zero.
! This is done within SUBROUTINE update_idx_lists_sea.
! If the ICON grid box is set ice-free during the initialization,
! no ice is created over the forecast period.
! If observational data indicate open water conditions for a given ICON grid box,
! residual ice from the previous model run is removed,
! i.e., the ice thickness is set to zero and
! the ice surface temperature is set to the fresh-water freezing point.
! The newly formed ice has the surface temperature equal to the salt-water freezing point
! and the thickness from 0.1 m to 0.5 m depending on the ice fraction.
! The new ice is formed instantaneously if the data assimilation scheme
! indicates the presence of ice in a given ICON grid box
! but there was no ice in that grid box at the end of the previous model run.
! Prognostic ice thickness is limited by a maximum value of 3 m and a minimum value of 0.05 m.
! Constant values of the ice density, ice molecular heat conductivity, specific heat of ice,
! the latent heat of fusion, and the salt-water freezing point are used.
!
! In uncoupled runs (no interaction of the ice slab with the ocean boundary layer beneath the ice),
! a simple ad hoc formulation of the heat flux from water to ice is used.
! Optionally, adaptive tuning of the parameter(s) of the temperature profile within the ice
! and of the heat flux from water to ice can be used that is based on the assimilation increments
! of the atmopsheric surface layer quantities.
!
! A detailed description of the sea-ice scheme is given in
! Mironov, D., B. Ritter, J.-P. Schulz, M. Buchhold, M. Lange, and E. Machulskaya, 2012:
! Parameterization of sea and lake ice in numerical weather prediction models
! of the German Weather Service.
! Tellus A, 64, 17330. doi:10.3402/tellusa.v64i0.17330
!
! The present sea-ice scheme (with minor modifications)
! is also implemented into the NWP models GME and COSMO
! (see Mironov et al. 2012, for details).
!
! Adaptive parameter tuning in NWP models is described in
! Zaengl, G., 2023:
! Adaptive tuning of uncertain parameters in a numerical weather prediction model

  !! Prognostic variables of the sea-ice parameterization scheme are initialized 
  !! and some consistency checks are performed. 
  !!
  !! The procedure arguments are arrays (vectors) of the sea-ice fraction, and 
  !! of the sea-ice scheme prognostic variables.
  !! The vector length is equal to the number of grid boxes (within a given block)
  !! where sea ice is present, i.e. where the sea-ice fraction exceeds its minimum value.
  !! First, the sea-ice fraction is checked. 
  !! If a value less than a minimum threshold value is found 
  !! (indicating that a grid box is declared as partially ice-covered but no sea ice 
  !! should be present), an error message is sent and the model abort is called.
  !! Next, "new" ice is formed in the grid boxes where "old" value of the sea-ice thickness
  !! is less than a minimum threshold value (i.e. there was no ice at the end 
  !! of the the previous model run). The newly formed ice has the surface temperature equal 
  !! to the salt-water freezing point and the thickness of 0.1 m to 0.5 m  
  !! depending on the ice fraction.
  !! For the grid boxes where new ice is created, prognostic sea-ice albedo is set equal 
  !! to its equilibrium value (function of sea-ice surface temperature).
  !! Then, the ice thickness is limited from above and below 
  !! by the maximum and minimum threshold values, 
  !! and the ice surface temperature is limited from above by the fresh-water freezing point. 
  !! These security measures (taken for each grid box where sea ice is present)
  !! are required to avoid non-allowable values of prognostic variables 
  !! that may occure due to a loss of accuracy during the model IO 
  !! (e.g. due to GRIB encoding and decoding).  
  !! Finally, the snow thickness is set to zero, and
  !! the snow surface temperature is set equal to the ice surface temperature 
  !! (recall that snow over sea ice is not treated explicitly).

  !! Prognostic variables of the sea-ice scheme are advanced one time step.
  !!
  !! Ordinary differential equations (in time) for the ice surface temperature and 
  !! the ice thickness are solved using an explicit Euler scheme for time advance.
  !! The sea-ice surface albedo with respect to solar radiation is determined  
  !! by solving a rate equation (if the sea-ice albedo is treated diagnostically, 
  !! no albedo calculations are performed in the present routine).
  !! The shape factor for the temperature profile within the ice and the derivative of the 
  !! temperature profile shape function at the underside of the ice are functions of the ice 
  !! thickness (see Mironov et al. 2012, for details).  
  !! Optionally, constant values of the shape factor and of the shape-function derivative
  !! corresponding to the linear temperature profile within the ice 
  !! (cf. the sea-ice schemes of GME and COSMO) can be used 
  !! (as there is no logical switch to activate this option, changes in the code should be made).
  !! In the regime of ice growth or melting from below, the solution may become spurious
  !! when the ice thickness is small and/or the model time step is large.
  !! In such a case, a quasi-steady heat transfer through the ice is assumed 
  !! and the differential equation for the ice surface temperature 
  !! is reduced to an algebraic relation. 
  !! In the current configuration of the sea-ice scheme, snow over ice is not treated explicitly. 
  !! The effect of snow is accounted for implicitely through changes
  !! of the sea-ice albedo with respect to solar radiation.
  !! For the "sea water" type grid boxes, the snow thickness is set to zero and
  !! the snow surface temperature is set equal to the ice surface temperature.
  !! Prognostic ice thickness is limited by a maximum value of 3 m and a minimum value of 0.05 m. 
  !! In "uncoupled" runs, i.e., where the interaction between the sea ice and the sea water 
  !! beneath is not considered, an ad hoc formulation for the heat flux from water to ice is used
  !! that serves to quench the ice growth rate as the ice thickness approaches its maximum value.
  !! No ice is created during the forecast period. 
  !! If the ice melts away during the forecast (i.e., the ice becomes thinner than 0.05 m), 
  !! the ice tickness is set to zero and 
  !! the ice surface temperatures is set to the fresh-water freezing point.
  !! The procedure arguments are arrays (vectors) 
  !! of the sea-ice scheme prognostic variables,
  !! of the components of the heat balance at the ice upper surface  
  !! (i.e., the fluxes of sensible and latent heat, the net flux of long-wave radiation,
  !! and the net flux of solar radiation with due regard for the ice surface albedo),
  !  of the precipitation rates of snow and rain,
  !! and of the sea-ice surface albedo with respect to solar radiation.
  !! Fluxes are positive when directed downward.
  !! The vector length is equal to the number of model grid boxes 
  !! (within a given block) where sea ice is present  
  !! (i.e., where the sea-ice fraction exceeds its minimum threshold value).
  !! The time tendecies of the ice thickness, the ice surface temperature, 
  !! the snow thickness and the snow surface temperature are also computed. 
  !! These are optional arguments of the procedure.
