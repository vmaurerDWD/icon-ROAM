## icon-ROAM

This repository contains parts of the source code of https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/icon-model/-/tree/release-2024.07-public , with modifications as in https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/icon-nwp/-/tree/icon-ROAM.
The source code as published here is containing interfaces to the OASIS3-MCT coupler based on [Hagemann et al. (2024)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/17/7815/2024/gmd-17-7815-2024.html), which can be used to couple the ocean model NEMO.
The configure scripts are modified compared to the version of the ICON public release that the coupling via OASIS is switched on (`--enable_coupling_OAS=yes` by default).
